# SmartFollowup

The SmartFollowup is an intuitive example usage of [Bluemix Push Notifications Service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobilepush/index.html?pos=2) with the help of [Watson Tone Analyzer Service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html) , [OpenWhisk](https://developer.ibm.com/open/openwhisk/) and [Cloudant Service](https://cloudant.com/).

The SmartFollowup app will register a feedback on the recently purchased items to the cloudant `complaints` database. The OpenWhisk will read changes in the `complaints` and will send data to Watson Tone Analyzer. The Tone Analyzer will send back the results to OpenWhisk. By analyzing the results, OpenWhisk will fetch appropriate message from Cloudant `moods` database and construct a valid message. This message gets pushed to `IBM Push Notifications service`, and is delivered to the mobile device.

##Requirements

* iOS 10
* Xcode 8.+
* Swift 3.+
* Cocoapods


### Setup Bluemix and Cloudant.

Complete the steps:

 Go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net and Log in. Click on [Catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/) on the top bar.

1. On the left pane click on `Boiler Plates` below Apps.  Create [MobileFirst service starter] app. This will have `Push notification service`.

2. Create an `Mobile Foundation` service.

3. Click on [Catalog](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/) on the top bar. On the left pane click on `Watson` below `Services`.Create  a `Watson Tone Analyzer` Service.

4. Create a database named `mood` in your [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/). In the `mood` database, create a view named `new_view` and design named `moodPick`.

5. Click the new design document you have created in step 3 and update it with the following lines. Do not have to change the `_id` and `_rev` values.

```
{
  "_id": "_design/moodPick",
  "_rev": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "indexes": {
    "fields": {
      "analyzer": "keyword",
      "index": "function(doc) {index("default", doc._id, {"facet": true});if ((doc.mood) || (doc.mood===0)){index("doc.mood", doc.mood);}if ((doc.message) || (doc.message===0)){index("message", doc.message);}}"
    }
  },
  "views": {
    "new_view": {
      "map": "function (doc) { emit(doc.mood,doc.message);}"
    }
  },
  "language": "javascript"
}

```

6. To the updated new design document, add messages for each emotions - `Fear, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Joy` (Watson Tone Analyzer outputs). For example,

```
{
"mood": "Joy",
"message": "thank you very much for your valuable feedback. We are extremely happy to here from you. Come back again have a wonderfull shopping experience with us."
}
```

7. In your Cloudant, create one more database named `complaints`. This will be used in iOS application

## Configure Push service

 Go to your push service and add `iOS` configuration. Please follow the doc [here](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-omnichannel-iclabs/NewsSeconds#create-apns-certificate) to create iOS certificates

## Setup the OpenWhisk.

The `BlueShoping.swift` file need the following parameters to complete the actions.

- `appId` - Bluemix app GUID.

- `appSecret` - Bluemix Push Notification service appSecret.

- `version` - This is the version of the [Tone Analyzer service](https://watson-api-explorer.mybluemix.net/apis/tone-analyzer-v3#/) .

- `cloudantUserName` - Your Cloudant username. This is for accessing your `mood` database in Cloudant.

- `cloudantPermissionKey` - Your Cloudant cloudantPermission Key. This is for accessing your `mood` database in Cloudant.

- `cloudantPermissionPassword` - Your Cloudant cloudantPermission Password. This is for accessing your `mood` database in Cloudant.

1. Open the OpenWhisk Web Editor, and create `swift` action. Replace the content of the action with `BlueShoping.swift`
2. Create a Cloudant package binding using the [Bluemix OpenWhisk CLI](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli).

  ```
    wsk -v package bind /whisk.system/cloudant CloudantPackage -p username 'cloudantUsername' -p password 'cloudantPassword'
    -p host 'yourUserName.cloudant.com' -p dbname 'complaints'
  ```

3. Create a OpenWhisk `Trigger`.

  ```
  wsk trigger create yourTriggerName --feed /yourNameSpace/CloudantPackage/changes
  ```

4. Create a rule to connect your action (step 1) and trigger (step 3)

  ```
  wsk rule create myRule yourTriggerName yourActionName
  ```

5. Open the SmartFollowup app in `XCode.app`. Go to the `AppDelegate.swift` file and add values for ,

  ```
  //cloudant
  var cloudantName:String = "Cloudant DB name"
  var cloudantUserName:String = "Cloudant Username"
  var cloudantPassword:String = "Cloudant password"
  var cloudantHostName:String = "Your cloudant host name"

  //Whisk
  var whiskKey:String = "OpenWhisk Key"
  var whiskPass:String = "OpenWhisk password"

  //Push Service
  var pushAppGUID:String = "push Service app GUID"
  var pushAppClientSecret:String = "push Service client secret"
  var pushAppRegion:String = "Push/AppID service region"

  //APPID
  let appIdTenantId = "your APPID tenant Id"
  ```

6. Do `pod install` in the application. And open `SmartFollowup.xcworkspace`

7. Run the application and Login using AppID.

8. Go to the feedback page and send feedback.

9. You will get push notifications as feedback response.
